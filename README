About this program.

This executable was created to test connectivity by doing a SOAP call to send an event to Varolii Support.
If there is an issue, you will see the output in the debug.log that gets written out.

Requirememnts.
This program was written in Ruby(http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)and converted to a Windows excutable using OCRA(http://ocra.rubyforge.org/).
The only requirement is that you run it on a windows box.  It was only tested using Windows 7 so there may be issues
with other flavors of Windows.


Steps to follow:
1.  Create a folder on your machine called EventCreate
2.  Extract the contents of the EventCreate zip file to the EventCreate folder you created.
3.  Edit the config.yml file and change COMPANYNAME to your Company Name.  eg.  ACME Corporation.
4.  Open a command prompt.  (Click the windows logo in the left hand corner of your task bar and type 'cmd' in the search box.
    Hit Enter.  This should open a terminal window.
5.  Navigate to your EventCreate folder.  (cd \EventCreate)
6.  Run eventcreate.exe simply by typing it in.
7.  After it is complete, a debug.log file should've been created.  Please send this log to Varolii Support.
