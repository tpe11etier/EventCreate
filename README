This program was written in Ruby(http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)and converted to a Windows excutable using OCRA(http://ocra.rubyforge.org/).
The only requirement is that you run it on a windows box.  It was only tested using Windows 7 so there may be issues
with other flavors of Windows.


Steps to follow:
1.  Create a folder on your machine called ConnectivityTest_EP
2.  Extract the contents of the ConnectivityTest_EP zip file to the ConnectivityTest_EP folder you created.
3.  Edit the config.yml file and change CHANGME to your Company Name.  eg.  ACME Corporation.
4.  Open a command prompt.  (Click the windows logo in the left hand corner of your task bar and type 'cmd' in the search box.
    Hit Enter.  This should open a terminal window.
5.  Navigate to your ConnectivityTest_EP folder.  (cd \ConnectivityTest_EP)
6.  Run ConnectivityTest_EP.exe simply by typing it in.
7.  After it is complete, a output.log file should've been created.  If the log contains an error, please send it to Varolii support. support@varolii.com
